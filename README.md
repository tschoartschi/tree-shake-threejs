# Tree shake Three.js

To see the results do the following steps:

```
npm install
node build.js
```

After that you should see an index.js file in the dist folder. To verify if the build file still works
open index.html. If you see a spinning cube everything worked out fine :-)

## Notes

This project is just a dummy to check if tree shaking Three.js works and if it makes sense. I'm not sure if
this project setup leads to the best results. If you know any improvements, let me know. Create a PR or get
in contact with me.
